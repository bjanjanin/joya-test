        <p>Welcome to the Joya Communications Inc website (the “Site”). The Site is owned and
            operated by Joya Communications Inc (“Joya Communications Inc,” “Company”, “we”, or
            “us”). We are making the Site and our video sharing and other mobile applications
            (“Apps”) (collectively, the “Service”) available to you subject to the following terms
            and conditions of service (the “Terms”). The Terms are a legal contract between you and
            Joya Communications Inc regarding your use of the Service (you and others using the
            Service will be referred to as “Users”). As long as you comply with these Terms, you
            have the right to download and install a copy of the Apps to your mobile device, and to
            access and use the Service, for your own personal use. By accessing and using the
            Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the
            Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms at any time, please do not use the
            Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Applicable Terms and Policies</h2>

        <p>a. Guidelines. When using the Service, you will be subject to any additional posted
            guidelines or rules applicable to specific services and features (the “Guidelines”). All
            such Guidelines are hereby incorporated by reference into the Terms.</p>

        <p>b. Privacy Policy. Please read our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>
            carefully for details relating to what information and data we collect from you and
            other Users, and how we use that information internally and disclose it to third
            parties. Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>

        <p>c. Modifications. From time to time, we may modify the Terms. If we do so, we will make
            the modified Terms available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest
            revision. We encourage you to review the Terms periodically for changes. Your continued
            use of the Service after revised Terms have become effective indicates that you have
            read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Terms. If you do not agree
            with any changes to the Terms, you must cease using the Service.</p>

        <p>d. Users Must Be 13 or Older. If you are opening an account on behalf of yourself, you
            represent that you are the age of majority in your jurisdiction and fully able and
            competent to agree to these Terms. If you are under 18, you may use the Service only
            with the involvement of a parent or guardian. In any case, you affirm that you are 13
            years of age or older, as the Service is not intended for, and does not knowingly
            collect personal information from, children under 13.</p>

        <p>e. Advertisements. Our Service may, at some point, include advertisements, which may be
            targeted to the content or information on the Service, queries made through the Service,
            or from other information. The types and extent of advertising on the Service are also
            subject to change over time. </p>

        <h2>2. Your Account</strong></h2>

        <p>a. Account Information. In order to use some features of the Service, you will have to
            create an account. When creating an account, you must provide true, accurate, current,
            and complete information. You also must ensure that this information is kept accurate
            and up-to-date at all times. You agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your
            account information and your Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith
            belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a)
            comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms; (c) respond to a claim that your
            Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond if you contact us; or (e)
            protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company, Users and the
            public.</p>

        <p>b. Password. When you register you will be asked to provide a password. As you will be
            responsible for all activities that occur under your password, you should keep your
            password confidential. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
            your account and password and for restricting access to your computers and mobile
            devices, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your
            account or password. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure
            (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your
            account ID or password), you should immediately notify us. You may be liable for the
            losses incurred by us or others due to any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <p>c. Prohibitions. When creating an account, you may not (a) provide any false personal
            information to us (including a false username) or create any account for anyone other
            than yourself without such other person’s permission; (b) use a username that is the
            name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (c) use a username
            that is subject to rights of another person without appropriate authorization; or (d)
            use a username that is offensive, vulgar or obscene or otherwise in bad taste. We
            reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if any information provided
            during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, false or
            misleading or to reclaim any username that you create through the Service that violates
            our Terms.</p>

        <p>d. Termination. You agree that we may terminate your account or use of the Service at any
            time in our sole discretion, and you agree that we shall not be liable to you or any
            third party for any such termination. If we terminate your access to the Service, your
            Content will no longer be accessible through your account, but such Content may persist
            and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been shared or re-shared).</p>

        <p>b. Representations and Warranties Regarding Your Content. You represent and warrant that
            (a) you own your Content or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and
            license as provided in these Terms, and (b) the sharing of your Content on or through
            the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract
            rights or any other rights of any person.</p>

        <p>c. Prohibitions. When submitting Content to or otherwise using the Service, you agree not

            falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage us, our Users or any third party; (c)

            inappropriate; (e) post advertisements; or (f) upload Content that would be harmful to
            minors in any manner.</p>

            governmental body. We reserve the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove

                    </p>
                    <p>Unless you and Joya Communications Inc agree otherwise in writing, the
                        arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation

                            YOU AND JOYA COMMUNICATIONS INC. ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL

                        agree that any dispute as to the arbitrability of a claim brought by either
                        you or Joya Communications Inc. shall be resolved by a court of competent
                        jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                <p>

                        conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the
                        arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
                        The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of
                        the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by
                        the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be

            to the DMCA by providing our Copyright Agent designated below with the following

            confirm these requirements): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person
            authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
            infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed,
            or, if multiple copyrighted works on the Service are covered by a single notification, a
            representative list of such works from the Service; (c) identification of the material
            that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is

            sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (d) information reasonably sufficient to
            permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and,
            if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be
            contacted; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use
            of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,
            its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is
            accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act
            on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Upon removing
            any allegedly infringing material, we will notify the alleged infringer of such
            takedown. Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly
            materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to
            liability.</p>

            The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute part
            of these Terms, and shall not limit or affect any provision hereof. The relationship of
            the parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and these Terms will not be
            construed to imply that either party is the agent, employee, or joint venturer of the
            other. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, these
            Terms will continue in full force and effect without said provision and will be
            interpreted to reflect the original intent of the parties. These Terms will be governed

            written consent of Company, and any prohibited assignment will be null and void. Waiver
            by either party of a breach of any provision of these Terms or the failure by either
            party to exercise any right hereunder will not operate or be construed as a waiver of
            any subsequent breach of that right or as a waiver of any other right. YOU AGREE THAT
            ANY CAUSE OF ACTION BROUGHT BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE MUST
